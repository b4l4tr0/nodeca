[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/nodeca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/nodeca)

Platform, for medium and big traffic projects, written with node.js

* Bleeding edge demo: **http://dev.nodeca.com**
* Design process: https://github.com/nodeca/nodeca-design
  (materials can be outdated)


Requirements
------------

* node.js
* MongoDB (big size, images are stored in GridFS)
* redis
* sphinx search
* GraphicsMagick
* nginx (for production)

Please, note, that since Nodeca is for medium/big projects, we have no goal to run it on
cheapest VPS. Memory requirements depends on stored image volume - we use GridFS to simplify
maintainability of big collections. May be, sometime, we will add alternate file store
for starter projects, but now we just have no time for it.


Installation
------------

See [instructions](https://github.com/nodeca/nodeca/blob/master/INSTALL.md).


About
-----

Basically, this project was started as [RC Design](http://forum.rcdesign.ru)'s
next generation platform, and funded by me, Vitaly Puzrin :) . But since i'm
opensource fan, source code has no specific locks to my needs, and distributed
under MIT licence.

Here are ton's of reasons, why Nodeca started:

1. __Easy development/maintenance__. No ancient manual downloads of php sources,
   boring upgrades and missed security fixes. Just use github, Luke! And node.js's npm.

2. __Very fast, scaleable to infinity__. Forget about CPU load. Just add one more shard,
  when db is out of space. We use MongoDB, wich makes sharding/replication trivial,
  and protects from injections.

3. __HTML5, mobile-in-mind__. Not just modern look, but modern internals too.
  Content automatically fitted to screen size and resolution. Very fast load.
  Retina-ready - all icons as vector fonts. SEO-friendly. No needs to maintain multiple
  products in parallel - website is good for all devices, without compromisses.

4. __Realtime updates & client-side rendering__. Any page can be automatically updated
  without full reload, when new information added. When user navigates site with modern
  browser, only raw data is loaded, without html - very fast responce time.
  See [our demo](http://dev.nodeca.com/), and pay attention to timeline at the end
  of each page.

5. __With medium/big projects in mind__. Commercial "forums" are optimized for maximum
  sell volumes. So, their first-class customers are small sites. Medium/Big ones have
  another needs - mainteinability, scaleability, highload, security. Nodeca is here :)
