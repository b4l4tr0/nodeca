About
-----

Basically, this project was started as [RC Design](http://forum.rcdesign.ru)'s
next generation platform, and funded by me, Vitaly Puzrin :) . But since i'm
opensource fan, source code has no specific locks to my needs, and distributed
under MIT licence.

Nodeca includes a lot of modern web technologies and is designed for high loads.
